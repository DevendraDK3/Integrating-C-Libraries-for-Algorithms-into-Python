**README: Integrating C Libraries for Algorithms into Python using SWIG**

## Introduction
This repository demonstrates how to integrate C libraries containing algorithms into Python using SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator). SWIG is a powerful tool that facilitates the connection between C/C++ code and various high-level programming languages, including Python. By using SWIG, we can leverage existing C libraries and expose their functionalities to Python, allowing us to use the algorithms seamlessly within a Python environment.

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up the environment and integrate C libraries with Python:

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have C and C++ development tools installed on your system.
2. Install SWIG: [SWIG Installation Guide](https://swig.org/download.html)

### Clone the Repository
```
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-c-library-to-python.git](https://github.com/DevendraDK3/Integrating-C-Libraries-for-Algorithms-into-Python.git)
cd algorithm-c-library-to-python
```

### Build the C Library
1. Navigate to the `c_library` directory containing the C implementation of the algorithm(s).
2. Follow the instructions in the `README` file inside the `c_library` directory to build the C library.

### Generate the SWIG Interface
1. Navigate to the `swig_interface` directory.
2. Run SWIG to generate the Python interface from the C header file. For example, to generate the interface for Python 3:
```
swig -python -py3 -outdir ../python_bindings your_algorithm.i
```

### Build the Python Bindings
1. Navigate to the `python_bindings` directory.
2. Build the Python bindings using the provided `setup.py` file:
```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

### Test the Integration
1. Use the Python script in the `python_bindings` directory to test the integration. The script should import the C library's functionality and demonstrate the use of the algorithm(s) in Python.
